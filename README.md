## Root folders

This section will map out the root folders structure.

This module is an archive of the original SNU root, without any of the modules added in.

### Super root

The super root folder is the root folder that holds all the other root folders. No files should go below the super root file, pretend like the superroot is the C:// level, not the C://Directory1/File1.html level.

### Root M3V1

`M3V1` (Milestone 3 Version 1) is the root folder for the first version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.0) it originally didn't have very many files or modules, and is the oldest modern build of SNU.

### Root M3V2

`M3V2` (Milestone 3 Version 2) is the root folder for the second version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.1) it originally didn't have very many files or modules, and is one of the oldest modern builds of SNU.

### Root M3V3

`M3V3` (Milestone 3 Version 3) is the root folder for the third version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.2) it also originally didn't have very many files or modules, and is the third oldest modern build of SNU.

### Root M3V4

`M3V4` (Milestone 3 Version 4) is the root folder for the fourth version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.3) it also originally didn't have as many files or modules, and is the fourth oldest modern build of SNU.

### Root M3V5

`M3V5` (Milestone 3 Version 5) is the root folder for the fifth version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.4) it contains a lot more modules and files compared to the previous 4 versions, and this version was the first to have longer support.

### Root M3V6

`M3V6` (Milestone 3 Version 6) is the root folder for the sixth version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.5) it contains way more files compared to the previous releases, and was the second version to have a longer support period.

### Root M3V7

`M3V7` (Milestone 3 Version 7) is the root folder for the seventh version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.6) it contains far more files compared to the previous releases, and was originally supposed to end support on June 14th 2020. However, a transition to GitHub completely changed the schedule, allowing this version to continue to retain support.

### Root M3V8

`M3V8` (Milestone 3 Version 8) is the root folder for the eighth version of SNU 3.x (SNU 3.0.7) it has not yet entered development.
