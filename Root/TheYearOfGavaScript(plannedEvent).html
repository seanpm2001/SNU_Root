<!-- <H1>The year of GavaScript (Pride Year for SNU)</H1> !-->
<p>I have noticed that the creator of JavaScript, has done some questionable things</p>
<p>I feel that it would be wrong to just write portions of the site in JavaScript, and allow JavaScript support without addressing this issue.</p>
<p>I have decided that when I raise enough money from the site, once I have some exposable money, I will start hosting site-wide charity events. This is the first charity event I have planned.</p>
<p>The term 'GavaScript' is a play on JavaScript, replacing the J with a G. Why am I doing this?</p>
<p>Brendan Eich (the creator of ECMAScript, which later became JavaScript) donated $1000.00 against a same-sex marriage campaign. This controversy happened years ago, but no-one has really done anything as of recently about it. JavaScript is still all over the web.</p>
<p>JavaScript isn't going anywhere anytime soon, but action must be taken. So as a charity event, all people who program JavaScript will get special benefits for writing JavaScript. My plan is to donate $0.01 each to 10 different charities for every 100 kilobytes of JavaScript written.</p>
<p>I am basing the requirement off the base 10 binary system, so this would be 100,000 bytes, not 102,400 bytes.</p>
<p>I am also sick of all these companies jumping on the Pride Week bandwagon, and doing absolutely nothing to help the movement. I am not gay myself, but I believe that people should be able to have this choice.</p>
<p>So for my site, instead of pride week, I am going to have pride year, which starts on the first day of pride week, and ends on the first day of pride week on the next year, with an extra week to celebrate more.</p>
<p>Even if Brendan makes up for this, I am still going to host this event.</p>
<p>Not a single cent of this revenue will go towards my own site, it will ONLY go to charity.</p>
<p>Also, no Java doesn't count, only JavaScript.</p>
<p>To influence this event, videos and other content about Javascript, and web development will have a higher feature rate, and will be recommended to more people.</p>
<p>Users who help in any way will receive special benefits on the site, such as badges, titles, awards, gold, platinum, bronze, silver, statistics, and shoutouts. Developers should help out on this project.</p>

=========
Every 10 kilobytes of Javascript written will generate $0.01 to a charity, 100 KB = 10 charities with $0.01
Notes
1 KB = $0.001 (single charity)
10 KB = $0.01 (single charity)
100 KB = $0.01 each
1 MB = $0.10 each
10 MB = $1.00 each
100 MB = $10.00 each
1 GB = $100.00 each
10 GB = $1000.00 each 
100 GB = $10000.00 each 
1 TB = $100000.00 each
10 TB = $1000000.00 each
Donations are also welcome
Plan: Donate $10,000,000.00 to human rights charities by developers writing 10 Terabytes of JavaScript anywhere on the developer section of the site ($1,000,000.00 per charity)
Not a single cent will go to our company, it will all be donated to charity
It isn't pride week... it is pride year!
Brendan Eich (the creator of ECMAScript, the predecessor to Javascript) did some things that go against basic human rights. 
Offenses include donating $1000.00 to a charity that goes against same-sex marriage. 
For this reason, we can't use Javascript on our site without doing something about this.
The idea for this charity event was launched on June 11th 2019 as a first charity idea for the site. We hope to make up for Brendan Eich's actions with this charity.
It is now his time to come forward on this. He can still change.
Every additional kilobyte past the goal will continue being donated to charity, until the end of the event 365 days after its start. Contributers to the project will receive
special benefits on the site, such as badges, titles, awards, gold, platinum, bronze, silver, statistics, and shoutouts. Developers should help out on this project.
At the end of the event, the donation amount will be posted, along with all contributers, which can be sorted from highest byte count to lowest byte count, or highest donation to lowest donation
We will not profit off of this in any way. Unlike other companies on pride week, we are doing something, and not just blindly jumping on the bandwagon. Do your part!
Videos and other content about Javascript, and web development will have a higher feature rate, and will be recommended to more people.
